Stuff for Darktable open-source photo editor (themes, presets, etc...)

## Troubleshoot 

If the styling doesn't seem to apply despite following the instruction you can always open Darktable with logs using the Terminal

Example on mac : 
```
/Applications/darktable.app/Contents/MacOS/darktable -d all
```
